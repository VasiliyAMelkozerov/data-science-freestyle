# Wabba jakka auto job appa

----------

This here will host my information reguarding the project for building out exactly what I need to get this thing up and running.

This project has a couple of different moving parts.
1. Something that logs into linked in.
    - That goes over to the jobs tab and works through each one of the entries.
2. To autofill job applications based on personal information needed to be processed.
    - It would also locally store a list of the company name as well as the postition.

I have found Selenium so far as a good library to be able to traverse the internet with.
